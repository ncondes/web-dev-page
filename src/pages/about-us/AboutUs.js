The Foundation joined a quality improvement project in 1999 with UNICEF, ICBF, and other foundations, enhancing protection processes for street children, earning high quality ratings from ICBF in 2000. Achieving ISO 9001:2000 certification in 2005 underscored its commitment to quality. Between 2006 and 2007, it led a national project against child labor, aiding 2,950 children and their families. In 2007, with ICBF support, it collaborated on the "Bogotá Towards an Inclusive City" project, benefiting 544 children and 220 families, focusing on reducing street life risks through Centers of Hospitality and Coexistence over five years.

In 2003, the foundation received its first international cooperation agreement from JICA (Japan International Cooperation Agency), funding Rescue Patrols and training workshops at La Esperanza for three years. That same year, Schneider Electric France supported a Pre-employment and Vocational Training project, including a bakery workshop. The St. Patrick facility opened in 2003 for a Residence Program, largely supported by COTA Ireland. In 2004, the Emergency Center program was launched, and Fundación ÉXITO, with contributions from its French partner CASINO, equipped the Casacorazones facility, provided by the National Directorate of Narcotics. Additionally, the Italian organization XMAS Project from Milan contributed funds to purchase the house for the Albachiara facility.
